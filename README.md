# SpeechToText-LLM
A light speech to text LLM attatched to a language model, as other models for Python Libraries do not seem to accurately understand my voice.

This project was heavily inspired by "The AI Hacker" on Youtube; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YereI6Gn3bM
Please note that this is a learning experience for me and some sections shall be the same code as shown in the video. This is his GitHub; https://github.com/LearnedVector/A-Hackers-AI-Voice-Assistant
